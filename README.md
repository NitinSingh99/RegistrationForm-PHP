# RegistrationForm-PHP
In this small-scale web development project, I have designed and implemented a user registration form using HTML and CSS, seamlessly integrated with a MySQL database managed through XAMPP. This project aims to demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS and PHP, particularly in creating functional forms and storing user data securely in a database.
